MADRID WHEN THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR BROKE OUT IN 1936 . BUT HE WAS ALSO A

MEMBER OF THE SPANISH COMMUNIST PARTY, AND HIS PROFESSIONAL POLICE

BARCELONA, FERRETING OUT SUPPORTERS OF FRANCISCO FRANCO . PART OF

GRIMAU'S JOB WAS TO SERVE ON KANGAROO COURTS, CALLED CHEKAS (AFTER THE

ONETIME INITIALS OF THE SOVIET SECRET POLICE), WHICH ORDERED DOZENS OF

SUMMARY DEATH SENTENCES DURING THE BRUTAL THREE-YEAR WAR . AFTER THE

REPUBLICAN COLLAPSE GRIMAU FLED, WORKED AS A COMMUNIST AGENT IN

CZECHOSLOVAKIA, RUSSIA, MEXICO AND CUBA . A MEMBER OF THE CENTRAL

COMMITTEE OF THE OUTLAWED SPANISH COMMUNIST PARTY, HE WAS LIVING IN

FRANCE WHEN HE SLIPPED ACROSS THE FRONTIER IN 1959 TO REORGANIZE THE

SPANISH COMMUNIST UNDERGROUND . AFTER SEVERAL TRIPS IN AND OUT OF SPAIN

SINCE 1959, AN INFORMER GAVE HIM AWAY TO POLICE IN MADRID LAST NOVEMBER

. FRANCO'S COPS CLAPPED HIM IN JAIL AND BEGAN A LENGTHY INTERROGATION .

DURING ONE SESSION, GRIMAU LEAPED, FELL, OR WAS PUSHED FROM A

FIRST-FLOOR WINDOW, FRACTURING HIS SKULL AND BOTH ARMS . LAST WEEK,

WITH A LARGE DENT IN HIS FOREHEAD, GAUNT, BALDING GRIMAU HEARD A

PENALTY WAS DEATH . DID HE CARE TO SAY SOMETHING BEFORE SENTENCE WAS

PASSED ONLY THIS, " REPLIED GRIMAU . " SINCE 1936, I HAVE LIVED THE

LIFE OF A COMMUNIST . I WILL DIE A COMMUNIST . " THEN HE TOOK HIS SEAT

AND LISTENED INTENTLY AS THE COURT PRONOUNCED THE SENTENCE EVERYONE

EXPECTED DEATH . THIS WAS THE CUE FOR COMMUNIST DEMONSTRATIONS IN HALF
