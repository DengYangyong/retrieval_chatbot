GREAT BRITAIN THE LOSS OF LUTON THE BOOMING AUTOMOBILE-MAKING

TOWN OF LUTON, TORY PARTY CHAIRMAN JOHN HARE DECLARED RECENTLY, IS " A

MICROCOSM OF THE BRITAIN WE ARE BUILDING . " IF SO, IT MAY BE THE

SOCIALISTS WHO WILL TAKE OVER THE CONSTRUCTION JOB . AT A BY-ELECTION

LAST WEEK IN LUTON, 30 MILES NORTHWEST OF LONDON, VOTERS ELECTED A

LABOR M.P . FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 13 YEARS, TURNING THE TORIES' 1959

MAJORITY OF 5,000 VOTES INTO A THUMPING 3,749-VOTE MARGIN FOR LABOR .

MATTERS MOST, LIKE LUTON, TORIES ARE FARING BADLY . WHAT TROUBLES THE

TORIES IS THAT LUTON IS A SIGN OF TORY AFFLUENCE, WITH INDUSTRIAL

PAYROLLS THAT HAVE BOOSTED WAGE LEVELS 20 PER CENT ABOVE THE NATIONAL

AVERAGE . LUTON HAS A BIGGER-THAN-AVERAGE SHARE OF THE FASTGROWING

MIDDLE CLASS THAT HAS KEPT THE CONSERVATIVES IN OFFICE FOR TWELVE YEARS

WON OUT OVER TORY SIR JOHN FLETCHER-COOKE, 52, A TWEEDY, MUSTACHED
