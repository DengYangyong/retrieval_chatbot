AFRICAN POETRY

WHERE GOD IS BLACK MOST BLACK AFRICANS

ONLY LEARNED TO WRITE DOWN THEIR SONGS AND TALES IN THE PAST HUNDRED

YEARS, BUT THEY ARE HEIRS TO CENTURIES OF ORAL LITERATURE . IN THEIR

SEARCH FOR AN AFRICAN IDENTITY, THE CONTINENT'S CONTEMPORARY POETS MANY

OF THEM LEADING POLITICIANS TODAY HAVE FORSAKEN THEIR MISSION-SCHOOL

GOLDEN TREASURY TO REDISCOVER THE PAGAN RHYMES AND RHYTHMS THAT

ENLIVENED TRIBAL LIFE LONG BEFORE THE WHITE MAN CAME . SAYS LEOPOLD

SEDAR SENGHOR, WHO IS BLACK AFRICA'S MOST DISTINGUISHED POET AS WELL AS

PRESIDENT OF SENEGAL : " POETRY MUST FIND ITS WAY BACK TO ITS ORIGINS

. " THE ATTEMPT TO EXPLORE AND REVIVE THESE ORIGINS IS ILLUSTRATED IN A

NEW ANTHOLOGY, POEMS FROM BLACK AFRICA (INDIANA UNIVERSITY PRESS ;

$4.95), EDITED BY U.S . NEGRO POET LANGSTON HUGHES . SOME OF THE POETS

ARE SELF-CONSCIOUSLY PRIMITIVE, AND A FEW OF THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING ONES

WRITE WITH ECHOES OF T . S . ELIOT OR GERARD MANLEY HOPKINS . BUT THEY

ARE ALSO BUSY TRANSCRIBING AND TRANSLATING TRADITIONAL FOLK

TO ADHIAMBO I HEAR MANY VOICES LIKE IT'S SAID A

MADMAN HEARS ; I HEAR TREES TALKING LIKE IT'S SAID A MEDICINE MAN

HEARS . MAYBE I'M A MADMAN, I'M A MEDICINE MAN . MAYBE I'M MAD ; FOR

THE VOICES ARE LURING ME, URGING ME FROM THE MIDNIGHT MOON AND THE

SILENCE OF MY DESK TO WALK ON WAVE CRESTS ACROSS A SEA . MAYBE I'M A

MEDICINE MAN HEARING TALKING SAPS, SEEING BEHIND TREES ; BUT WHO'S

LOST HIS POWERS OF INVOCATION . BUT THE VOICES AND THE TREES ARE ONE

NAME SPELLING AND ONE FIGURE SILENCE-ETCHED ACROSS THE MOONFACE IS

WALKING, STEPPING OVER CONTINENTS AND SEAS . AND I RAISED MY HAND MY

TREMBLING HAND, GRIPPING MY HEART AS HANDKERCHIEF AND WAVED AND WAVED

AND WAVED BUT SHE TURNED HER EYES AWAY . GABRIEL OKARA

JAZZ ORCHESTRA : TRUMPET SOLO

POETRY AND EVOLVING WHAT ANTHOLOGIST HUGHES HOPEFULLY DESCRIBES AS A

LITERATURE THAT " WALKS WITH GRACE AND ALREADY IS BEGINNING TO ACHIEVE

AN INDIVIDUALITY QUITE ITS OWN . " MOST OF THE BLACK NEW WAVE POETS ARE

CONCERNED WITH NEGRITUDE, A FRENCH WORD FOR THE ESSENCE OF BLACKNESS

AND, BY EXTENSION, FOR A WORLD IN WHICH DESPAIR IS WHITE, WHILE GOD AND

INNOCENCE ARE BLACK . MANY WRITERS CELEBRATE NATURE AND MEMORIES OF A

PRISTINE AFRICA . MOST ARE PREOCCUPIED BY THE WEST'S FAILURE TO

UNDERSTAND THEM . BUT IN THEIR POETRY IF NOT IN THEIR U.N . SPEECHES

AFRICANS WASTE SURPRISINGLY LITTLE TIME INVEIGHING AGAINST IMPERIALISM,

NOTWITHSTANDING A TIRADE BY A PART-TIME POET NAMED PATRICE LUMUMBA, THE

LATE, RABBLEROUSING CONGOLESE LEADER ( " FOR A THOUSAND YEARS, YOU,

AFRICAN, SUFFERED LIKE A BEAST . . . " ) . A SAMPLER OF VOICES FROM THE

NEW AFRICA :

FIRST I WAS

CONFUSED BY YOUR BEAUTY, BY THOSE GREAT GOLDEN LONG-LEGGED GIRLS . SO

SHY AT FIRST BEFORE YOUR METALLIC EYES, YOUR FROSTED SMILE SO SHY . AND

THE ANGUISH IN THE DEPTHS OF SKYSCRAPER STREETS LIFTING EYES HAWKHOODED

TO THE SUN'E ECLIPSE . SULPHUROUS YOUR LIGHT AND LIVID THE TOWERS WITH

HEADS THAT THUNDERBOLT THE SKY THE SKYSCRAPERS WHICH DEFY THE STORMS

WITH MUSCLES OF STEEL AND STONE-GLAZED HIDE . FF BUT TWO WEEKS ON THE

BARE SIDEWALKS OF MANHATTAN AT THE END OF THE THIRD WEEK THE FEVER

SEIZES YOU WITH THE POUNCE OF A LEOPARD . . . NEW YORK ! I SAY TO YOU

: NEW YORK ! LET BLACK BLOOD FLOW INTO YOUR BLOOD THAT IT MAY RUB

THE RUST FROM YOUR STEEL JOINTS, LIKE AN OIL OF LIFE THAT IT MAY GIVE

TO YOUR BRIDGES THE BEND OF BUTTOCKS AND THE SUPPLENESS OF CREEPERS .

NOW RETURN THE MOST AICIENT TIMES, THE UNITY RECOVERED, THE

RECONCILIATION OF THE LION, THE BULL AND THE TREE THOUGHTS LINKED TO

ACT, EAR TO HEART, SIGN TO SENSE . THERE ARE YOUR RIVERS MURMURING WITH

SCENTED CROCODILES AND MIRAGE-EYED MANATEES . AND NO NEED TO INVENT THE

SIRENS . BUT IT IS ENOUGH TO OPEN EYES TO THE RAINBOW OF APRIL AND THE

EARS, ABOVE ALL THE EARS, TO GOD WHO OUT OF THE LAUGH OF A SAXOPHONE

CREATED THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH IN SIX DAYS . AND THE SEVENTH DAY HE

SLEPT THE GREAT SLEEP OF THE NEGRO . LEOPOLD SEDAR

SENGHOR (SENEGAL) WHERE THE

RAINBOW ENDS WHERE THE RAINBOW ENDS THERE'S GOING TO BE A PLACE,

BROTHER, WHERE THE WORLD CAN SING ALL SORTS OF SONGS, AND WE'RE GOING

TO SING TOGETHER, BROTHER, YOU AND I, THOUGH YOU'RE WHITE AND I'M NOT .

IT'S GOING TO BE A SAD SONG, BROTHER, BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW THE TUNE,

AND IT'S A DIFFICULT TUNE TO LEARN . BUT WE CAN LEARN, BROTHER, YOU AND

I . THERE'S NO SUCH TUNE AS A BLACK TUNE . THERE'S NO SUCH TUNE AS A

WHITE TUNE . THERE'S ONLY MUSIC, BROTHER, AND IT'S MUSIC WE'RE GOING TO

SING WHERE THE RAINBOW ENDS . RICHARD RIVE (SOUTH

AFRICA)
